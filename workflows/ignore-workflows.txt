# The workflows that should be ignored should be the full path name relative
# The path of the workflows to be ignored should be written out in full, 
# relative to the current directory. For example, if the workflow 
# "workflow.ipynb" exists in "directory", then to ignore it be sure to write
# out "directory/workflow.ipynb".
